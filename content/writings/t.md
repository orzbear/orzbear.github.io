# Takaichi Sanae’s Push for Technological Sovereignty is Reshaping Cross-Strait Power

Japan’s new Prime Minister **Sanae Takaichi** has often been framed as a staunch nationalist and ideological heir to Shinzo Abe — pro-Taiwan, anti-China, and hawkish on defence. But her early weeks in office suggest something different. Instead of symbolic confrontation, Takaichi is investing political capital into *crisis-management spending* and *digital deterrence* — a doctrine that fuses economic security with technological sovereignty. Her approach shifts Japan’s strategy from ideological posturing to infrastructural power, positioning technology at the core of both domestic governance and regional diplomacy.

## From Digital Reform to Digital Deterrence

Unlike her predecessors, who treated digitalisation as an administrative upgrade, Takaichi frames it as national defence. Her flagship concept, **crisis management investment**, merges economic and military logic: expanding fiscal support for artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum technologies to secure what she calls Japan’s “growth through security.”

Japan’s updated **National Security Strategy** now lists cyber and cognitive warfare alongside conventional threats — marking a shift from digital transformation to digital deterrence. Takaichi maintains that “wars now begin in the digital domain,” meaning protection of data, infrastructure and supply chains is now treated as an act of sovereignty.

## Implications for Taiwan

This evolution brings both opportunity and risk for Taiwan, which sits at the centre of China’s digital and industrial offensive. In 2025, Taiwanese authorities reported a surge in China-based cyberattacks aimed at eroding public trust. At the same time, multiple espionage cases involving the theft of **TSMC chip secrets** underscored that semiconductors — the backbone of Taiwan’s economy — have become prime targets for strategic coercion.

For Taiwan, advanced chips, AI systems and resilient digital infrastructure are no longer just commercial assets; they are instruments of deterrence and diplomacy.

## Toward a New Japan–Taiwan Technology Partnership

Takaichi’s doctrine mirrors Taiwan’s own: technology as sovereignty. Cooperation could extend beyond chip production to:

- joint cybersecurity frameworks  
- shared data standards  
- coordinated export controls  
- alignment with U.S. strategic priorities  

Taiwan contributes semiconductor dominance and frontline cyber-defence experience; Japan brings fiscal capacity and industrial scale. Together — within the U.S.–Japan alliance and the broader Indo-Pacific strategy — they could anchor a trusted regional tech network linking Taiwan, Japan, India and Australia.

Yet collaboration also carries tension. Japan’s ambition for technological self-sufficiency may gradually reduce reliance on Taiwan’s manufacturing ecosystem. As Tokyo securitises digital infrastructure, it may prioritise domestic production and restrict sensitive technology flows. What was once a complementary relationship could evolve into **parallel supply chains** divided by security boundaries.

## China’s Strategic Dilemma

Beijing has long portrayed Takaichi as a hard-line conservative. But her strategy poses a deeper challenge than rhetoric: it targets China’s *structural influence*. Her decision to postpone a visit to the Yasukuni Shrine was a calculated move to maintain diplomatic manoeuvrability ahead of possible talks with Xi Jinping — without shifting her foundational goal of reducing China’s technological leverage.

Japan’s renewed focus on **rare-earth cooperation** with the United States and Pacific partners threatens one of China’s most potent tools of economic coercion. Diversifying mineral supply chains erodes China’s dominance and strengthens the linkages between Japan, Taiwan, India and Australia.

## Redefining Cross-Strait Structure

By weaving technology, supply-chain resilience and resource policy into a single strategic framework, Japan is reshaping the structure that underpins cross-strait relations. Its push for digital deterrence, rare-earth independence and regional technology standards reduces Asia’s systemic dependence on China while building new layers of interdependence centred on Japan.

This shift both complicates Taiwan’s leverage and constrains China’s influence.

## The Path Forward

For Taiwan, the challenge is turning alignment into adaptability — investing in cybersecurity, cross-border data governance and next-generation semiconductor innovation to sustain its value as regional tech networks deepen.

For China, the path lies in recalibrating its engagement through stable economic channels and transparent technology norms to prevent escalating digital competition.

## Conclusion

Takaichi is often compared to Abe, but the analogy misses the scale of her transformation. Abe sought constitutional reform to normalise Japan’s military posture. Takaichi seeks **technological sovereignty** to secure economic and strategic autonomy. Infrastructure — not ideology — has become the new measure of influence.

And that shift will quietly but decisively redefine the balance across the Taiwan Strait.
